## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention

All feature branches must be named after their Linear issue:

```
feature/HEL-<issue_number>
```

Examples:
- `feature/HEL-6` (Add responsiveness for Auth page)
- `feature/HEL-14` (Fix tab switching on business page)

### Branch Flow

```
feature/HEL-# → develop → main
```

1. **feature/HEL-#**: Feature branches for individual issues
   - Created from `develop`
   - Named after Linear issue (e.g., `feature/HEL-6`)
   - PR into `develop` when complete

2. **develop**: Integration branch
   - All features merge here first
   - Used for testing and QA
   - PR into `main` when ready for release

3. **main**: Production branch
   - Deployed to production
   - Only receives merges from `develop`
   - Protected branch

### Workflow

1. Pick up a Linear issue (e.g., HEL-6)
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/HEL-6 develop`
3. Implement the fix/feature
4. Create PR: `feature/HEL-6` → `develop`
5. After review and merge, create PR: `develop` → `main` for deployment

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev           # Start dev server

# Build
npm run build         # Production build

# Linting
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
```

## Linear Integration

Issues are tracked in Linear under the HelloML workspace:
- **Team:** HelloML
- **Issue prefix:** HEL-
- **Labels:** Bug, Feature, Improvement

When committing, reference the issue:
```
git commit -m "HEL-6: Add responsive styles to auth page"
```

## Claude Code Guidelines

### Git Operations
- **Always seek user approval before executing any git operations** (commit, push, pull, merge, checkout, branch creation/deletion, stash, etc.)
- Present the intended git command and wait for confirmation

### Comments and Documentation
- **All comments and notes should be added to Linear** using the Linear MCP, not in code comments
- Keep code comments minimal and only for complex logic that isn't self-evident

### Commit Messages
- **No emojis** in commit messages
- **Do not include "generated by Claude Code"** or similar AI attribution
- Use the format: `HEL-#: Brief description of change`
- Keep messages concise and descriptive
- Examples:
  - `HEL-6: Add responsive styles to auth page`
  - `HEL-14: Fix tab click handler on business page`
  - `HEL-18: Display user transcription in call history`
